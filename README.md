# Web3 CAD Tools

Developer tools to enable CAD designers and Web3 artists with on-chain and open source raster graphics editor for free form drawing, editing using Filecoin and Web3 ecosystem tools.

We wish to enable constructionist learning by empowering Web3 designers, game developer community and DeSci educators to build design assets and empower their artistic aspirations utilizing filecoin/IPFS's strengths in information eco-system.

Web3 CAD tools's normal interface is split into five sections:

- Toolbox, containing the various basic tools (see below) and application controls (undo, save, new, print)

- Canvas, where the images are drawn and edited

- Color palette, where colors can be chosen (when applicable to the current tool)

- Selector, providing various selectable objects (e.g., brushes, fonts or sub-tools, depending on the current tool)

- Information area, where instructions, tips and encouragement are provided


Design experiments to try using FIL CAD

- Add stamps and pictures;

- Import images from IPFS and upload images as NFTs to IPFS via NFT.Storage

-  Add notes using pencil and save them to RDBMS using Tableland

-  Encrypt design assets using Lit protocol.

# Blockchain Eco-system

We are using using Filecoin Blockchain and Data Tools, NFT.storage, Tableland and Lit and OSS Web3 tools.

# NFT.Storage

We are developing a dapp using NFT.storage that let us export the CAD (Computer Aided Design) file generated from Web3 CAD tools as an NFT and upload it to IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are extending NFTUp dapp both for Post PC and PC devices using ionic low code, no code framework and are using FVM Calc for tabulation, organization and export of the CAD file output as an NFT.
